Networking is the process of connecting computers and other devices to share information and resources. It allows devices to communicate with each other, both locally and over long distances, using different protocols and technologies.

The OSI Model The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a theoretical framework for understanding network communication. It consists of seven layers, from the physical layer (Layer 1) to the application layer (Layer 7), each responsible for specific functions in data transmission.

Types of Networks There are different types of networks, such as:

LAN (Local Area Network): Small geographic area, used for local communication. WAN (Wide Area Network): Large geographic area, connects LANs over long distances. Internet: Global network of interconnected networks. IP Addresses IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices on a network for identification and routing. There are two kinds: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

TCP and UDP TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols. TCP offers reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP is connectionless and faster.

Ports Ports are logical endpoints for communication, used to identify specific services or applications on a device. Examples include SSH (Port 22), HTTP (Port 80), and HTTPS (Port 443).

Ping and ICMP “Ping” is a network utility that uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to test device connectivity and measure round-trip time for packets.

Subnetting Subnetting is the practice of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks, allowing for efficient IP address allocation and network management.

IPv4 and IPv6 IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, offering a larger address space. Both versions coexist in today’s networks.

Localhost Localhost refers to a device’s loopback network interface (usually 127.0.0.1), used for self-testing and local communication.
