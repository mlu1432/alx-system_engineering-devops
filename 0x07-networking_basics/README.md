## Networking Basics Project
# This project encompasses an exploration of fundamental networking concepts using various tools and scripts. The aim is to deepen understanding of the OSI model, the differences between TCP/UDP, the purpose of ICMP, and the function and significance of MAC and IP addresses within network communication.

# Files
Each script or text file in this project is associated with a particular networking concept or command.

# 0-OSI_model
A file containing answers to questions about the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, detailing its purpose and organization.

# 1-types_of_network
A text file that describes the different types of networks: LAN, WAN, and the Internet, including their typical usage scenarios.

# 2-MAC_and_IP
This file contains answers to questions regarding MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, explaining their unique purposes in network communication.

# 3-UDP_and_TCP
A visual aid explaining the functions and characteristics of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) within the OSI model.

# 4-listening_ports.sh
A Bash script that displays listening ports on a system, along with the process IDs and names of the programs associated with each socket.

# 5-is_the_host_on_the_network.sh
A Bash script designed to ping an IP address five times to check network connectivity and latency.

# Concepts
Below is a brief overview of the concepts addressed in this project.

# OSI Model: A seven-layer model used to conceptualize the different processes involved in network communication.
# LAN and WAN: Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks, respectively, serving different geographic areas.
# MAC Address: A hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network.
# IP Address: A software identification number that allows a network device to be identified and located within a network.
# TCP and UDP: Protocols used for transmitting data over a network, with TCP providing reliability and UDP offering speed.
# ICMP and Ping: ICMP is used for sending diagnostic or control messages within a network, with the ping command being a common utility that uses ICMP to test connectivity.
Usage
Each script comes with detailed comments explaining its function. To use a script, ensure it is executable with the command chmod +x script_name.sh and then run it from the terminal.

For the files containing textual answers, these are for reference and to be used as educational material to understand the networking concepts discussed.

Conclusion
The material in this project provides foundational knowledge in networking, useful for beginners looking to grasp the basics of how devices communicate and share information.
