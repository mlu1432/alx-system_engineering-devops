Web Infrastructure Design
This repository outlines the design and structure of web infrastructures ranging from simple to complex configurations, aimed at hosting the website www.foobar.com. Each design tackles different aspects of web hosting challenges, including scalability, security, and monitoring.

Overview
The project is divided into several tasks, each designed to enhance the web infrastructure progressively:

Simple Web Stack
Distributed Web Infrastructure
Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
Scale Up (Advanced)
Task 0: Simple Web Stack
A basic web infrastructure design featuring a single server with a LAMP stack.

Components:

1 server hosting:
Web Server (Nginx)
Application Server
Application Files (Code Base)
Database (MySQL)
1 domain name (foobar.com) configured with a WWW record pointing to the server IP (8.8.8.8)
Design Challenges:

Understanding the roles of each component in the stack.
Identifying the Single Point of Failure (SPOF), maintenance downtime challenges, and scalability issues.

Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure
An enhanced web infrastructure design featuring three servers, including a load balancer.

Components:

2 additional servers
Split components across servers:
Web Server (Nginx)
Application Server
Load-Balancer (HAproxy)
Application Files (Code Base)
Database (MySQL)
Design Challenges:

Explaining the addition of each component.
Configuration and role of the load balancer.
Database replication strategies and the significance of Primary-Replica setups.

Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
A secure and monitored infrastructure design featuring encryption, firewalls, and monitoring services.

Components:

3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate for HTTPS
3 monitoring clients
Design Challenges:

Justification for each additional component.
Importance of HTTPS and firewalls.
Monitoring strategies and tools.

Task 3: Scale Up (Advanced)
An advanced task focused on scaling the web infrastructure.

Components:

1 additional server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured in a cluster with another load balancer
Split components across their servers
Design Challenges:

Explanation of the addition of each component and its necessity.
